/*** CHAPTER                          9                          FUNCTIONS ***/

functions are the building blocks of C programs
each function is like a small program with its own declarations and statements
using functions, we can divide a program into small pieces that are easier for
    us, and others, to understand and modify
functions are reusable, allowing us to take a function that was part of one
    program and us it in others
